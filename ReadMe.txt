For the Jupyter Notebook file with the extension ipynb to run the file run all the cells at once
Input files are added as a form of list and one after another is executed.

Incase a input file needs to be added, add it in input_files list in the bottom cell.

Another python file is added for running it use

$ python 160101052.py [input_file]

Note:large benchmark inputs are taking too much time and computer is being freezed.
So they have not been tried.
